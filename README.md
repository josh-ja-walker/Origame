# Origame

This game was made by myself - code, design, sound effects - with some downloaded assets. 

I made this game for my coursework and got an A/A* so check it out and see if I should've failed the class.

I did my best to showcase what I thought was an interesting and exciting mechanic that could be built further into a fully-fledged game. At the moment its more of a demo, but please check it out and tell me what you think.
